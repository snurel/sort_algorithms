# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of five popular sorting algorithms in Java, along with tests and time complexity information for each algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Prerequisites

- Java 14 or higher
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VSCode)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/snurel/sort_algorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
   cd sort_algorithms
   ```

## Time Complexity

| Algorithm        | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(n)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     |
| Selection Sort   | O(n^2)    | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     |
| Insertion Sort   | O(n)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n^2)     |
